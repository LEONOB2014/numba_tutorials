# Information

This repository contains all notebooks, which are used in my [blog](https://kratzert.github.io/) for my little Numba tutorial series.

Beside the notebooks, I wrote an [introductory article](https://kratzert.github.io/2017/09/12/introduction-to-the-numba-library.html), where I explain what Numba is and for what you can use it.
